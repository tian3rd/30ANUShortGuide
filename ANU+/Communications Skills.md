## Communication Skills Reflection

> "Communication works for those who work at it."

At the start of semester two of 2020, I volunteered to work as a general hand at the warehouse of Vinnies, Belconnen. During the first twenty hours of work at Vinnies, the one development outcome I want to reflect on is my _communication skills_.

My job is to assist Shaun and other volunteers to organize and sort all kinds of donations to the right places. After the brief induction, I get the hands-on practice because people are driving their donations here constantly. At first, I get confused at what to keep and what to recycle. I'm a little nervous to ask around, so I pile the things up on the desk for later sorting. However, the piling doesn't work for long, so I ask Shaun to guide me through the standards of sorting by showing him the donations which I'm not sure of. Shaun is kind to give me some tips to streamline the sorting process as well.

Another thing is that I don't know the name and the functionality of the donations to begin with. For example, one guy brings with him the racing simulator, and it looks very exotic to me because I've never seen anything like that before. So I ask Shaun for advice and sort that to the corner section where we gather the large equipmens for later use. Usually I just hold the donations and ask Shaun on the way because it's the efficient way to handle the rush hour when people are coming with heaps of donations all at once. After several weeks, I gain more experience and during the tea break, I would ask about other sorting sections in our warehouse, and the staff are warm-hearted to give me a chance to try for myself.

Gradually, I can fill in the vacancy quickly even without them asking. The communication (even in a non-verbal form) helps improve the collaborations quite a lot.

    - Step 4: Discuss the lab topics in the Piazza forum
  - Lab 1 - Week 1 - Trobleshooting (by Xinghao Li from piazza)
    - Cannot login to the Lab Machine
      - Solution: Go to https://cs.anu.edu.au/streams/login.php, log in, and wait for 10 minutes, then try again.
    - Image Import Error
      - Solution: 1. Make sure the ova file is fully downloaded (~1.9GB). 2. Make sure you imported the *.ova file, not the *.iso file.
    - Unable to open the virtual machine in your own laptop/PC (VT-X disabled).
      - Solution: Make sure your CPU supports virtualization (most of them do), then check the BIOS if it is enabled.
    - No IP address shown under enp0s3 (use 'ip addr' or 'ifconfig')
      - Solution: Make sure you enabled the network adapter (right click the "two computer" icon at the lower right corner, then click 'connect network adapter'). Also you need to make sure "DHCP" is enabled for the Host Network Manager (see Q5 below).
    -  The IP address shown starts with 10 (e.g. 10.0.2.15).
      - Solution: Make sure you selected the "host only adapter" in the network setting.
    - Cannot click OK button in the network setting after selecting the Host Only Adapter.
      - Solution: If you cannot click OK button, go File->Host Network Manager, and click "Create".
    - You got two same IP address in different VMs (e.g. 192.168.56.101).
      - Solution: Make sure you selected "Reinitialize new MAC address......" when importing the image. Or you can manually change the MAC in the settings.
    - Difference between OVA and OVF: https://sites.google.com/site/vblog77/notes/ovf-ova
    - My own problems: Everyone has a free download space of up to 5 GB, so when I download files that add up to 5 GB, the PC crashes and force me to log out. The way to deal with it is to delete the files and use the scratch folder instead which has more than 100 GB in the cloud.
    - Extra resource: Virtual Box VM file link: https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/FEhtnfbpufo7MJq

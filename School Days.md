# All things Happed at school

> This is an experiment diary to record my days at school. The idea is that if I pay so much to get back to school again, I better make use of every minute while at it. 

## Oweek


My day 1:

- Where's what @Kambri: It's basically a show-around tour of a central park of the uni. Start from kambri, walk to CBE through Copland building and look around some unilodge halls then take a turn to go to school of arts and walk on the grass to the law school and turn around to fellows oval and end in the university avenue to look for the welcome of your school fellas. 
- Set4ANU @Marie Reay(MR) L6: Basically a face to face chat with old blood in the school which they call mentor. You can ask some naive questions if you want.
- Commencement Speech @University Avenue: Sit there and hope you are tall enough to see the face of the vice chancellor.
- Free Gym Tour @ANU Sport: Free to hire facilities before 2pm!
- Chifley Tour @Chifley: this form is a little unexpected.
- End up in Chifley for the rest of my day at school: Thinking about how to enroll in the courses in a way that makes sense...

My day 2:

- Road: first encounter of congestion on road
- Fake News @MR L5: It's a useful introduction to help you spot fake news and use some fundamental rules like TRAAP.
- Using Sources @MR L5: Basically it taught you how to use others' work as references in your essay correctly, including quoting, paraphrasing, summarising. 
- CECS Welcome Lunch @Hanna Newmann: Boring. Except for the fire alarm which usually is false.
- Find Part-time & Casual Work @MR L2: General info and suggestions for fresh year students.
- Work in Australia @MR L2: Australian way of work attitudes and how to modify your CVs with Australian flavour(eg: no DOB, address recommended, referees contacts...)
- End up again at Chifley. But it'll be nice to check Hancock library next time since hot food is allowed there and books regarding to computer science are located there. 

My day 3:

- Applied Data Analytics @Peter Karmel: A short intro to data analysis in social science.
- Karl Marx @Hayden-Allen: Young idealists trying to discuss a way out of this world of inequality.
- Referecing @MR-L2: A useful intro on how to use references in  essays or articles.

My day 4:

- New at ANU @MR-L6: Friendly suggestions for newcomers from abroad.
- Future Proof Your Degree: A useful class to get you prepared for the job market and opportunities. Include some useful tips/info to get started.
- Survive and Thrive @MR-L5: Fundamental rules to bare in mind. Only attended the first session for insurance, laws, etc.
- CECS Academic advisory session: What a disappointment! Inconsistant locations, messed-up booking system and impatient advisors. I have to say it is far below my expectation. 

My day 5: Slept over. Will spend most of my time in library.

# All things Happed at school

> This is an experiment diary to record my days at school. The idea is that if I pay so much to get back to school again, I better make use of every minute while at it. 

## Oweek


My day 1:

- Where's what @Kambri: It's basically a show-around tour of a central park of the uni. Start from kambri, walk to CBE through Copland building and look around some unilodge halls then take a turn to go to school of arts and walk on the grass to the law school and turn around to fellows oval and end in the university avenue to look for the welcome of your school fellas. 
- Set4ANU @Marie Reay(MR) L6: Basically a face to face chat with old blood in the school which they call mentor. You can ask some naive questions if you want.
- Commencement Speech @University Avenue: Sit there and hope you are tall enough to see the face of the vice chancellor.
- Free Gym Tour @ANU Sport: Free to hire facilities before 2pm!
- Chifley Tour @Chifley: this form is a little unexpected.
- End up in Chifley for the rest of my day at school: Thinking about how to enroll in the courses in a way that makes sense...

My day 2:

- Road: first encounter of congestion on road
- Fake News @MR L5: It's a useful introduction to help you spot fake news and use some fundamental rules like TRAAP.
- Using Sources @MR L5: Basically it taught you how to use others' work as references in your essay correctly, including quoting, paraphrasing, summarising. 
- CECS Welcome Lunch @Hanna Newmann: Boring. Except for the fire alarm which usually is false.
- Find Part-time & Casual Work @MR L2: General info and suggestions for fresh year students.
- Work in Australia @MR L2: Australian way of work attitudes and how to modify your CVs with Australian flavour(eg: no DOB, address recommended, referees contacts...)
- End up again at Chifley. But it'll be nice to check Hancock library next time since hot food is allowed there and books regarding to computer science are located there. 

My day 3:

- Applied Data Analytics @Peter Karmel: A short intro to data analysis in social science.
- Karl Marx @Hayden-Allen: Young idealists trying to discuss a way out of this world of inequality.
- Referecing @MR-L2: A useful intro on how to use references in  essays or articles.

My day 4:

- New at ANU @MR-L6: Friendly suggestions for newcomers from abroad.
- Future Proof Your Degree: A useful class to get you prepared for the job market and opportunities. Include some useful tips/info to get started.
- Survive and Thrive @MR-L5: Fundamental rules to bare in mind. Only attended the first session for insurance, laws, etc.
- CECS Academic advisory session: What a disappointment! Inconsistant locations, messed-up booking system and impatient advisors. I have to say it is far below my expectation. 

My day 5: Slept over. Will spend most of my time in library.

- Don't forget that school days are simple in terms of the purpose and agenda. Once you get out, there will be a whole new situation which is exhausting. So appreciate it and make it worth. 
- After watching the movies, better have something to eat and go back to the library. Or it's a waste of time if you just go back home and give yourself an excuse to relax.

## Week 3

### Monday(Public Holiday: Canberra Day)

- 11.30-1: Fixed Assignment 1 errors and reviewed the Java codes for Lab test

### Wednesday

- Late morning. Got my 2 magazines from the reception at Unilodge. Wondered why the staff asked me for my contract files the second time.
- 11-12: Rode to school and did some planning for the day
- 12-1.30: Java Task 11 referencing

- 4-4.30: Read about the bfs in the Algs 4th Ed.
- After 4.30: Probably got sucked into the algorithms and lost track of time. Still, couldn't find out a way to solve it. 

### Thursday

- Got up late and rode to school
- 11-12: Math lecture @Ll
- 12-1: Tertiary to work tour only to find that all of the tech companies in Canberra require the PR or citizenship. Later after chatting with friends there is a skill to avoid it by not asking about it first. Unless the recruiters talk about it first, you don't talk about it or you will throw them a hard choice to them and offer them an excuse to turn you down. The other thing is that it's an option to study online for cloud-based technologies from Amazon or Microsoft to get certificates to add to the resumes. Fact is that it's possible to get a job offer with fluent English communications, solid backgrounds, relevant projects/experience and the passion about the role as early as the immigration department processing my PR application. It's probable to get a shot at the start-ups with the same requirements except for the citizenship/PR restrictions. So do my work   and focus on the career ambitions, improve the things I can improve and leave the rest to worry in the dreams only.
- 1.30-3: Math workshop/tutorial @HN1.27
